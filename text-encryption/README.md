# Secure Text Encryption Tool

This project demonstrates a **hybrid encryption system** combining
AES and RSA for secure data encryption.

## Features
- AES-GCM for fast and secure text encryption
- RSA for secure AES key exchange
- Demonstrates real-world encryption workflow

## Why Hybrid Encryption?
- AES is fast and efficient for large data
- RSA is secure for key exchange
- Used in real systems like HTTPS

## Technologies Used
- Python
- cryptography library

## Learning Outcomes
- Difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Importance of nonce and key management
- Secure design principles
